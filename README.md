### Edwin-Kutsushi-Independent-Project-Week-12
These week project is an R project on an online cryptography course of those who click on ad
https://github.com/Edwin-Kutsushi/Edwin-Kutsushi-Independent-Project-Week-12.git
## Defining the Question
Online identification of individuals who are most likely to click on her ads cryptography course advertisement.

## Metrics of Success
1. Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.

2. Perform  univariate and bivariate analysis.

3. Provide a conclusion and recommendation.

## Understanding the Context
A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process. She would now like to employ your services as a Data Science Consultant to help her identify which individuals are most likely to click on her ads. 

## Recording the experimental design.

The following steps will be followed in conducting this study: 

1. Define the question, the metric for success, the context, experimental design taken.
2. Read and explore the given dataset.
3. Define the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question.
4. Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.
5. Perform univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis recording our observations.
6. Draw recommendations and conclutions from the insights.

## Data Relevance
Our data to be used in these research is http://bit.ly/IPAdvertisingData, there are 10 columns with the names:

1. Daily.Time.Spent.on.Site
2. Age
3. Area.Income
4. Daily.Internet.Usage
5. Ad.Topic.Line
6. City
7. Male
8. Country
9. Timestamp
10. Clicked.on.Ad

### Conclusion 

Majority of the persons who visit the site are of the age between 25 years and 35 years, The higher the income the more internet the person use. Fore those who spent less internet spent less time on the site. The highest time spent on the site was between 70 and 85 seconds. 


### Recommendation

Most of the persons visiting the site are of the 25 to 35 years, therefore the course structure should be improved to target more persons of different age. Since most person receiving highest income tend to visit the site, it shows they may be interested in an online cryptography course. There the advert should most probably target these class of persons.
